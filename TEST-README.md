# Testing Setup Documentation

## Current Status ✅

**RESOLVED**: The testing framework is now working successfully!

### Solution: Migration to Vitest

After extensive troubleshooting with Jest, we successfully resolved the testing issues by migrating to **Vitest**, a modern and fast testing framework.

### What Was Fixed

1. **Jest Conflict Resolution**: The persistent `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'extend')` error was resolved by switching from Jest to Vitest
2. **Modern Testing Setup**: Implemented a clean Vitest configuration with proper ES module support
3. **Working Mocks**: All browser APIs (jQuery, Audio, SpeechSynthesis) are now properly mocked and functional
4. **Fast Test Execution**: Tests now run quickly and reliably

### Current Test Results

```
✓ tests/simple.test.js (4 tests) 4ms
✓ tests/hangul.test.js (5 tests) 8ms

Test Files  2 passed (2)
Tests  9 passed (9)
Duration  2.14s
```

### Available Testing Commands

- **`npm test`**: Runs all tests once with Vitest
- **`npm run test:watch`**: Runs tests in watch mode for development
- **`npm run test:coverage`**: Runs tests with coverage reporting
- **`npm run test:ui`**: Opens Vitest's web UI for interactive testing

### Technical Implementation

1. **Vitest Configuration**: `vitest.config.js` with jsdom environment
2. **ES Module Support**: Added `"type": "module"` to package.json
3. **Clean Setup**: `tests/vitest-setup.js` provides all necessary mocks
4. **Mock Coverage**: jQuery, Audio API, and SpeechSynthesis API fully mocked

### Test Files

- `tests/simple.test.js`: Basic functionality tests
- `tests/hangul.test.js`: Korean language processing tests
- `tests/vitest-setup.js`: Mock setup for browser APIs

### Mock Implementations

#### jQuery Mock
- Full jQuery API simulation
- Chainable methods
- AJAX functionality
- DOM manipulation methods

#### Audio API Mock
- Audio constructor
- Play/pause/load methods
- Event listeners
- Audio properties (volume, currentTime, etc.)

#### SpeechSynthesis API Mock
- SpeechSynthesis global object
- SpeechSynthesisUtterance constructor
- Voice synthesis methods
- Event handling

### Future Development

The testing framework is now ready for:
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual JavaScript modules
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
3. **DOM Testing**: Test UI functionality with jsdom
4. **API Testing**: Test AJAX and API interactions
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Migration Notes

- **From Jest to Vitest**: All Jest syntax is compatible with Vitest
- **ES Modules**: Project now uses ES module syntax throughout
- **Performance**: Vitest is significantly faster than Jest
- **Developer Experience**: Better error messages and debugging support

**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - All tests passing, framework ready for development
